# Predictive Maintenance Machine Remaining Useful Life Estimation using Deep Learning Technique
  
  
  This is my graduation project, I cann't share the code with public. I put a jupyter notebook file to show you some of my work.  
  Predictive maintenance lets you estimate when machine failure will occur
or the RUL of the machine. The well-known dataset for this problem is C-MAPSS (Commercial Modular
Aero-Propulsion System Simulation) dataset provided by the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration (NASA). This dataset contains simulated sensors data for different
turbofan engines generated over time, and have been used to study estimations of RUL.  
This thesis studies estimation of the RUL for CMAPSS data sets using a deep neural
network that consists of Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) with Feed-forward neural
network (FNN) with different architecture obtained by changing the network parameters like the number of layers, batch size, and optimizer used for training the model.
The results achieved by the proposed model in this thesis were compared with other
published results that used the C-MAPSS dataset. The comparison demonstrated the
competitiveness of the proposed model.
